ipywidgets
==========
Forked from jakevdp/ipywidgets. *NOTE* if you are looking for IPython table formatting (described [here](http://melissagymrek.com/python/2014/01/12/ipython-tables.html)), I have moved that to a separate package called ```itable``` available on [pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/itable/0.0.1) with source code at [https://github.com/mgymrek/itable](https://github.com/mgymrek/itable).

Static Widgets for IPython Notebooks

This is currently an experimental repository containing code which enables
static widgets to be used in the IPython notebook.

Demonstrations
--------------
See my posts on:

* [static build figures for presentations](http://melissagymrek.com/python/2013/12/13/ipython-presentations-build-figures.html).
* [formatted tables in IPython](http://melissagymrek.com/python/2014/01/12/ipython-tables.html)
